# FlightTools

This is a collections of scripts for processing airborne data.
Most of these scripts were written in the field, and the input/error checking is pretty weak right now.
It is also possible that I forgot to include a sub-function; if you encounter such an error, let me know.

Bugs/issues/suggestions for improvement can be directed to:

I hope this helps you do science better.
